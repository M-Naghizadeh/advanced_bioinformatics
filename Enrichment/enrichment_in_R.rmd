## Gene set enrichment analysis
 
 **Gene set enrichment analysis** (also **functional enrichment analysis**) is a method to identify set of **genes** or **proteins** that are over-represented in a large set of genes or proteins and may have association with disease phenotype. Gene sets are usually specific genes that are involved in a particular biological function or particular location in cells. To observe several gene sets refer to some of the databases that provide them such as **GO**, **KEGG**, **MSigDB**. Researchers performing high-throughput experiments usually perform enrichemnt analysis to see if a specific set of gene is overrepresented in their differentially expressed genes or not. To read a good introduction about enrichment analysis read [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_set_enrichment_analysis).
 
 To see the major collection of gene sets of MSigDB database refer to the [website](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb). Similarly gene sets from other databases such as KEGG and GO are accessible by database website. For example to see the gene set of *Toll-like receptor binding* in GO refer to [GO website](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035325).
 
 Furthermore, the gene sets of MSigDB in dataformat is packed in the R package **msigdbr** that can be used directly with **clusterProfiler**. 
 
```{r}
library(msigdbr)
msigdbr_species()
```
 Available collections of gene sets is MSigDB;
 
```{r}
library(msigdbr)
db <- msigdbr_collections()
db[0:20, ]
```
 As it is clear, the KEGG database has 186 gene sets. To see all the gene sets of KEGG for human;
 
```{r}
library(msigdbr)
df <- msigdbr(species = 'Homo sapiens', category = 'C2', subcategory = 'CP:KEGG')
str(df)
data.frame(table(df[, 3]))
```

 To see the list of genes in a particular KEGG gene set such as KEGG_CELL_CYCLE;

```{r}
genes <- df[df[,3] == 'KEGG_CELL_CYCLE', ][, c(3, 4)]
data.frame(genes)
```
### GO enrichemnt analysis
 To perform Gene Ontology enrichment analysis first we need a sample vector of genes (Differentially expressed genes in our microarray test). For this purpose we use genelist data in DOSE package.
```{r}
library(DOSE)
data(geneList)
head(geneList)
```
 Among these genes we select only genes with foldchange more than two as our differentially expressed gene list. 

```{r}
DEgenes <-geneList[abs(geneList) > 2 ]
length(DEgenes)
head(DEgenes)
```
 In order to perform ID conversion, Bioconductor provide annotation objects (OrgDb) for species. 
 
```{r}
library('org.Hs.eg.db')
```
 In this notebook we use clusterProfiler package in R to perform GSEA.

```{r}
library(clusterProfiler)
library(pathview)
library(enrichplot)
library(ggplot2)
```
 In order to perform ID conversion on DEgenes, bitr function in clusterProfiler is used.

```{r}
DEgenes.symbols <- bitr(names(DEgenes), fromType = 'ENTREZID',
            toType = c('ENSEMBL', 'SYMBOL'), OrgDb = 'org.Hs.eg.db')
head(DEgenes.symbols)
```
 To see the GO profile of a gene set at specific level groupGO is used.

```{r} 
ggo <- groupGO(gene = names(DEgenes),
                OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db,
                ont = 'CC',
                level = 3,
                readable = TRUE)
head(ggo)                
```
 overrepresentation analysis is performed to see if a gene set is overrepresented in your gene list. To perform overrepresentation analysis use enrichGO: 

```{r}
ego <- enrichGO(gene = names(DEgenes),
                universe = names(geneList),
                OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db,
                ont = 'CC',
                pAdjustMethod = 'BH',
                pvalueCutoff = 0.01,
                qvalueCutoff = 0.05,
                readable = T)
head(ego)
```

 gseGO is used to perform gene enrichment analysis of GO:
 
```{r}
DEgenes <- sort(DEgenes, decreasing = T)
gse <- gseGO(geneList = DEgenes,
        ont = 'ALL', 
        keyType = 'ENTREZID',
        nPerm = 10000,
        minGSSize = 3,
        maxGSSize = 800,
        pvalueCutoff = 0.05, 
        verbose = T, 
        OrgDb = 'org.Hs.eg.db',
        pAdjustMethod = 'none')
```       

```{r}
head(gse)
```

 To draw dotplot use the dotplot function:

```{r}
require(DOSE)
dotplot(gse, showCategory = 10, split = '.sign') + facet_grid(.~.sign)
```
 Use emapplot in enrichplot package to draw enrichment plot of gene enrichment analysis resutl.
 
```{r}
require(pathview)
emapplot(gse, showCategory = 10)
```
 use cnetplot in enrichplot package for gene-concept network plot:

```{r}
cnetplot(gse, categorySize = 'pvalue', foldChange = DEgenes, showCategory = 3)
```
 for ridgeline plot for GSEA result use ridgeplot of enrichplot package:

```{r}
ridgeplot(gse) + labs(x = 'enrichment distribution')
```
 for visualizing gsea result use gseaplot in enrichplot package:

```{r}
gseaplot(gse, by = 'all', title = gse$Description[1], geneSetID = 1)
```

 pmc plot;

```{r}
pmcplot(gse$Description[1:3], 2015:2021, proportion =FALSE)
```
